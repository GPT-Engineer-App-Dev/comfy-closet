# comfy-closet

Create a modern, stylish home page for a clothing ecommerce brand with the following elements:

- A full-width hero section with an impactful lifestyle photo, the brand name, a tagline capturing the brand essence, and a prominent "Shop Now" button

- Navigation bar at the top with the brand logo on the left, menu links to key pages (Home, Shop, About, Contact), and icons for search, account and cart on the right

- Featured categories section showing 3-4 key categories like New Arrivals, Dresses, Denim, Accessories with images and links

- Promo banner for any current promotions, sales or discount codes 

- Footer with links to customer service pages, social media icons, newsletter signup

Use a clean, editorial layout with plenty of whitespace. Employ a muted, sophisticated color palette and modern typography that matches the brand aesthetic.

For now, use placeholder content and images relevant to a clothing store. We can refine the content later.
